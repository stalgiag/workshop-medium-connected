export const marqueeText = 'TO MAKE A DADAIST POEM - Take a newspaper - Take some scissors - Choose from this paper an article of the length you want to make your poem - Cut out the article - Next carefully cut out each of the words that makes up this article and put them all in a bag - Shake gently - Next take out each cutting one after the other - Copy conscientiously in the order in which they left the bag - The poem will resemble you - And there you areâ€”an infinitely original author of charming sensibility, even though unappreciated by the vulgar herd.'
